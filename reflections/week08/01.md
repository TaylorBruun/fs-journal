It provides a set of examples of your work
```


2. What makes a Developer Portfolio effective?

Deliberately choosing portfolio pieces that show of particular relevant skills.
```

3. What projects do you have that you would include in your Portfolio? Why?
```
Right now? None of them because they are not yet polished. Future prospective portfolio pieces include Tower (because it is a good example of a full-stack application, our capstone, because it shows i can work in a group and will be reasonably polished, and a personal side project I have been cooking up for similar reasons to Tower)
