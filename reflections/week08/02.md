## Questions

1. Why is communication on a small team important?
```
Because each person is a relatively large amount of the total resources you have available - having just 1 person waste an afternoon is a more significant loss.
```

2. What adjustments from traditional sized scrum teams need to be made to use the agile methodology effectively in a small team?
```
Understand how each member of the team communicates and stay even more flexible with constant communication. Additionally, making sure that each tem member is fully invested in the software being delivered.
```

3. What is the unattainable triangle? What are the tradeoffs of each side?
```
the unattainable triangle is a framework for understanding tradeoffs between quality, speed, and cost of a project. Essentially, the more emphasis placed on one or two of these factors, the more stain is put on the third. (e.g., you can make a really high quality project really fast....if you spend a lot of money hiring an optimal number of experienced developers. Likewise, you can make a project very quickly at little cost...if you don't mind that it wont have many features or that they might not work very well)
