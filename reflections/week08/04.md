## Questions

1. What are the three main types of testing we can accomplish in Vue? What does each method provide?
```
Unit testing, which tests the smallest unit of code to ensure that it is working as intended, Component testing, which mounts individual components, and end-to-end testing, which looks at an entire use case for the application.
```

2. What testing method do you think is the most useful? Why?
```
Probably unit testing. This feels like a natural corollary to the 'code small debug small' mantra.
```

3. What testing method do you think is the least useful? Why?
```
I would think that component testing might be redundant if you have good unit tests and good end-to-end testing.
```
