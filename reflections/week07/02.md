## Questions

1. What is Code Documentation? What are some of the ways to document code?
```
Writing explanatory comments on how code functions. Some ways include writing independent guides, preparing a readme, and writing comments in the source code. 
```

2. What are some benefits of Code Documentation?
```
It will make it so you don't have to remember how your code works when you come back to it later ( or allow you to pass your code to someone else). It can also improve your intellisense if written in the source code.
```

3. How important is Code documentation and why?
```
Pretty important. Not all code can be written to have clear functionality without comments. Virtually all projects of any complexity will have multiple people working on them or, even with one person, work being done over a significant period of time.
