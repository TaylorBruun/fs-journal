## Questions

All of the interactions a user can have with a business. What the user wants to do and how they feel interacting with your design are key considerations. 
```

2. What are some benefits of taking into account the User Experience?
```
It can help lay out what actions will need to be doable on each page and keep an app organized.
```

3. Why is the User Experience important?
```
Code doesn't exist in a vacuum, the point is for it to be used. With a poor user experience, people might not bother to use your app at all.
