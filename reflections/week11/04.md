## Questions

Write a review and reflection of your experiences in this course, as this is the last lecture before your `final project`, what are your concerns, how do you plan to manage your time, what have you enjoyed most about the course up to this point.
```
Final concerns:
    I am a little worried that the final will just be an overwhelming volume of work. I am also concerned that there are a lot of things I want to get done before career week, so the pressure will be on to both do a good job on the final and also save enough time for other tasks.

Time management:
    I do not have a particular strategy in mind. I will feel things out as I go and let my unavoidable stress be a guide as to how much I need to get done at any particular moment. (Great strategy, I know).

Good course things:
    I really like when there is an interactive tool that can help us play with a new concept. The times I picked things up the fastest were flexbox froggy, the vue-playground, and the SQLBolt lessons. 

    I also like having different instructors throughout the course. Everyone here teaches with a really different style and it is cool to see things from multiple perspectives.
