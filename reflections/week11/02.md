## Questions

1. What is the difference between a `primary key` and a `foreign key`
```
primary keys define how to identify the item you are looking at - usually with a unique id. Foreign keys define a reference to the id of another table which contains information you want to associate with the item that has the foreign key.
```

2. What is an `Alias`?
```
A shorthand method of referring to something (for example, when we write SELECT a.* in our sql, the a is an alias for the accounts table).
```

3. Demonstrate how you would query a join statement that would get all of a doctors patients from the following collections:

```SQL
CREATE TABLE doctors (
  id INT NOT NULL AUTO_INCREMENT,
  -- CODE OMITTED
  PRIMARY KEY (id)
)

CREATE TABLE patients (
  id INT NOT NULL AUTO_INCREMENT,
  -- CODE OMITTED
  PRIMARY KEY (id)
)

CREATE TABLE doctors (
  id INT NOT NULL AUTO_INCREMENT,
  doctorId INT NOT NULL,
  patientId INT NOT NULL,

  FOREIGN KEY (doctorId)
    REFERENCES doctors(id),
  FOREIGN KEY (patientId)
    REFERENCES patients(id),
)

This sql has two tables with the same name ('doctors'). That is going to cause some problems. Go talk to your DBA about how they want to fix this. (Then join the relationship table to the patients table and use a group by to cluster patients by doctor)
