## Questions

1. What technologies and principles are you using in your project?
    ```
    The google static maps API and Yelp fusion API. We attempted to use scrum methodology.
    ```

2. What went well so far?
```
Being willing to adapt our plans as our vision of the project evolves. We were also pretty good at distributing work on most portions of the app.
```

3. What would you do differently? Why?
```
Work harder to use scrum methodology. We were pretty new to it, so it was hard to stick to the structure. It would really help keep us on task (and give us a better idea of what other people were doing) if we could adhere more strongly to the methodology.
