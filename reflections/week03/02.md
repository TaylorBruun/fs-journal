## Questions

1. What is the purpose of Encapsulation?
```
to restrict what is allowed to change or access certain data 
```

2. What were some of the problems with closures and the underscore prefix?
```
They were not adhered to widely enough to create a uniform convention
```



3. How do we create private variables in a ES6 Class? Why would you do this?

```
using a # prefix and defining them within the scope of the class. This 'enforces' data privacy instead of relying on the underscore convention (which could be ignored)
```
