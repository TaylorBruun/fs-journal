## Questions

1. What is Scope ?

```
The range within which a variable exists. (As in, globally, or only within a function, or only within its curly-brace bound block)
```

2. What is Hoisting ?
```
Hoisting is where the variable is pulled to the top of the code. Depending on the type of declaration used, the variable will be initialized as undefined or not initialized
```

3. In what cases might you use let vs const vs var?

```
Use var if you need a globally defined variable or a variable that is initialized as undefined. 

let is appropriate for block scoped variables.

const is best for variables that cannot change their value once assigned.
```
