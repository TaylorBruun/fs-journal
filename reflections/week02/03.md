## Questions

1. What are the main ways to write information to the console? Why/when should you use each style.

```
    console.log and console.error. Logging is useful to print out the information you need at a specific point in your code - for example, you could print the value of a variable that is giving you trouble to see if it has the value you expect. Error messages might be more useful for when you anticipate the possibility of a specific problem and you can log to the console that that problem has occurred 
```

2. Which tab allows you to see the breakdown of HTML/CSS and how can this tab be useful when debugging HTML?

```
The elements tab - this can be useful because it will show you what is applying to each element. It also allows you to adjust CSS values directly instead of having to do so in the code and refresh the page
```

3. Outside of writing everything to the console, what is a better way to debug your code?

```
Liberal use of the debugger!
