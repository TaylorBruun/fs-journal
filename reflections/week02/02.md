## Questions

1. What are the three ways to syntactically write a function? What are the differences in how the function acts (if any)?

```
By using the function keyword, by creating a variable that is definied as a function, and by using arrow notation. Using the variable method means that the function is not hoisted -- it is not pulled to the top of the code when it runs and is therefore not usable before it is defined. Arrow functions do not have their own this value, but I have no idea what that means yet.
```

2. What is the difference between Parameters and Arguments?

```
Parameters are the "generic" names which are part of the function definition. Arguments are the "specific" values of those parameters which are used when the function is called.
```

3. What are higher order functions? Can you provide an example?
