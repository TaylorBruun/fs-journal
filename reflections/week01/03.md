## Questions

1. What is your favorite tip that you think is the most beneficial to improving your design?
```
Use fewer text sizes. I am too easily tempted to start with an h1 and then just increment every time I think I have reached a lesser category of importance. Page titles are h1! Sections are h2!! Subheadings are h3! etc, etc. The end result looks like the internet from 2004. 
```
2. Compile a couple resources that you think might be helpful when trying to review examples of good design ideas.
```
I think you can get pretty good exposure to different good design ideas by visiting websites of large organizations that care about public image. They have the resources and incentives to design their websites well. Go look at fifa.com. Or the website for Coke. It doesn't even have to be a for-profit corporation. unesco.org/en looks quite good. fundforpeace.org looks great and really emphasizes their mission.
```
3. How do you think good design influences people when visiting a website and what sorts of things could you convey through design alone?
```
Good design seems like it would allow a user to simply do what they visited the website to do. Bad design would serve as a distraction. Although I doubt most users consciously think about design choices when using a site, it could convey a certain attention to detail or an idea about how the site is meant to be used. (I've heard people say that Snapchat's design is deliberately obtuse so that only younger people with more free time will bother to figure out all its features. That sounds a little crazy to me, but the idea that design can convey who a site is for and how it should be used makes sense).

```
Bootstrap has a lot of really powerful tools that can help me design quickly, but sometimes if I don't fully understand what the bootstrap class is doing (or it is doing a lot of things I don't want or need), it is better to design a class myself.
