## Questions

1. What is the purpose of wire-framing? 
```
To understand and prompt decision making about the overall requirements and design of a project
```
2. What are the different levels of detail in wire-frames and why is each one useful?
```
Wireframes come in low, medium, and high fidelity. Low is useful for initial project ideas and understanding basic layout and design. Medium is more refined and might allow us to hone in on what types of content are offered in our basic outline. High fidelity allows us to make more specific decisions about content and fine-tune design elements.
```
3. Do you think wire-frames are worth the Time, Energy, and Effort that they require? Why or Why not?
```
Yes. It will probably depend on the project, but even the very simple website cloning projects we have been working on have benefited from some wireframing. The TEE cost for wireframing is quite low and the benefits are substantial in that they will allow us to begin the project without having to constantly stop and switch back to a more planning-oriented mindset. Wireframing breaks our time into more efficient chunks by allowing us to make a significant set of big-picture decisions, then go build it, then come back and refine those decisions.

```
A lot of tools designers use are well-adapted to use for group work and if you use those features of those tools it can save a lot of time and help you focus on coding instead.
