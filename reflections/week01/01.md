## Questions

1. In your own words, why do we use Git?

Git allows us to save our work with version control/management.

2. What are the benefits of having multiple branches?

Multiple projects can be based on the same code. Several parts of the code can be worked on at the same time.

3. What is the difference between Git and GitHub

Git is local, managing the changes you make on a single computer. GitHub is remote, and can manage your code for multiple users at the same time.
