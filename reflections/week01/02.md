## Questions

1. What is a Pseudo-Class and what are some of the most common ones you think you will use
```
a pseudo-class seems to me like a more specific rule that applies to the class only in certain circumstances. So far the one I have seen the most is the :hover pseudo-class. I can imagine that we will use more of these as we start using more objects that can have variable states. Maybe if a video is playing, we cant something styled differently?
```
2. What is Specificity and how might you use it to your benefit?
```
it is a property that determines which of several conflicting styles will apply. It could be useful when we have identified a specific subset of a class or element (or any group really) that we would like to be styled differently from our default styling for that same group
```
3. What problems do you think you could run into if you over-utilized the !important feature?
```
it could be difficult to easily change the styling because a style you might not think would ordinarily apply (because it was loaded earlier and/or has low specificity) would apply because of the important tag. Also, if everything is important you would have to resort to other means to make a style apply where you have actually identified a narrow instance where a style really should be marked important. In other words, if everything is important, nothing is.
