## Questions

1. What is the purpose of `Async`/`Await`?
```
To write asynchonous code in a way that is more readable and simple than explicitly using callbacks or promises
```

2. What must you do in order to  `await` a promise inside of a function?
```
Prepend the async keyword to the function and use the await keyword before the promise you want to get a response from
```

3. What are some of the primary benefits of `Async`/`Await`?
```
It is much more readable than callbacks or explicit promises. It is also very easy to chain async functions together. Last, it is easier to debug because it looks like synchronous code to the compiler (so your debugger will stop in a relevant spot)
