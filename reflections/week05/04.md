## Questions

1. What is a virtual property?
```
an extra property value that isn't stored in the database
```

2. When might you use a virtual property? 
```
Anytime you might frequently want to know something about the database object, but it isn't stored as part of the object. Instead, it requires a calculation or other operation to be performed on those values that are stored.
```

3. How do you search by a virtual properties value?
```
Search where? virtuals are not stored in the database, so can't be searched there. I guess you could save the virtuals into an array or something then search that, but it seems like it would be more efficient to just craft a more complex database query.
