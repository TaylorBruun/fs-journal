## Questions

1. In simple terms what is timeboxing?

```
partitioning your time and scheduling specific tasks in those time chunks as the only time available for that task
```

2. What three strategies will you implement and how?
```
Realisitically I am not going to implement any of these stategies (because I think I already do a version of the tips that I think are useful, and the rest does not seem like a system that would fit me). If you want to know which 3 I think would be most useful, they are: doing anything that will take less than 2 minutes immediately, deliberately scheduling things for the period of time when I know I am most productive, and doing the think I least want to do first.
```

3. Give an example of when you would have benefitted from timeboxing and how? 
```
I do not think there is such an example -- I don't think this time management would be effective for me/improve on what I already do.
